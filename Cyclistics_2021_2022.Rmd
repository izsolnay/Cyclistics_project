# Cyclistics 2021-2022 Analysis in R on RStudio

### Final project for Google Analytics Certificate

## Prepare data

#### Set up initial environment by loading packages:

```{r installing packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(rmarkdown)
```

#### Import files Divvy data files from October 2021-September 2022 and simplify file names:

```{r import data files, results = "hide"}
Oct_2021 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Nov_2021 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Dec_2021 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Jan_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Feb_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Mar_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Apr_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
May_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")
June_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
July_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Aug_2022 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
Sept_2022<- read_csv("~/Desktop/FINAL PROJECT/2021-2022 original files/202209-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

#### Check each file for proper import by column and row count (not including header):

```{r row count}
dim(Oct_2021)
dim(Nov_2021)
dim(Dec_2021)
dim(Jan_2022)
dim(Feb_2022)
dim(Mar_2022)
dim(Apr_2022)
dim(May_2022)
dim(June_2022)
dim(July_2022)
dim(Aug_2022)
dim(Sept_2022)
```

#### Check that all column names are in agreement:

```{r agreement of column names}
colnames(Oct_2021)
colnames(Nov_2021)
colnames(Dec_2021)
colnames(Jan_2022)
colnames(Feb_2022)
colnames(Mar_2022)
colnames(Apr_2022)
colnames(May_2022) 
colnames(June_2022)
colnames(July_2022)
colnames(Aug_2022)
colnames(Sept_2022)
```

#### Check a sample of Oct_2021 to get a feel for the data frame:

Note many NAs.

View(Oct_2021)

## Process (wrangling, cleaning, and transformation)

#### Columns in agreement, so bind into fiscal and seasonal quarters:

```{r bind into quaters}
fiscal_year_2021_2022_1Q <- bind_rows (Oct_2021, Nov_2021, Dec_2021)
fiscal_year_2021_2022_2Q <- bind_rows (Jan_2022, Feb_2022, Mar_2022)
fiscal_year_2021_2022_3Q <- bind_rows (Apr_2022, May_2022, June_2022)
fiscal_year_2021_2022_4Q <- bind_rows (July_2022, Aug_2022, Sept_2022)
```

#### Check row and column counts:

```{r check counts}
dim(fiscal_year_2021_2022_1Q)
dim(fiscal_year_2021_2022_2Q)
dim(fiscal_year_2021_2022_3Q)
dim(fiscal_year_2021_2022_4Q)
```

#### Bind all quarters into new data frame entitled "cyclistic_2021_2022":

```{r bind into one df}
cyclistic_2021_2022 <- bind_rows (fiscal_year_2021_2022_1Q,fiscal_year_2021_2022_2Q,fiscal_year_2021_2022_3Q,fiscal_year_2021_2022_4Q)
```

#### Check that files bound and check out new data frame:

```{r new df}
glimpse(cyclistic_2021_2022)
```

#### Check out the variables for the columns rideable_type and member_casual:

```{r check specifics}
table(cyclistic_2021_2022$member_casual)
table(cyclistic_2021_2022$rideable_type)
```

#### Rename columns ride_id, started_at, ended_at, rideable_type, and member_casual:

```{r rename}
cyclistic_2021_2022 <- cyclistic_2021_2022 %>% 
  rename(trip_id = ride_id
         ,bike_type = rideable_type
         ,start_time = started_at
         ,end_time = ended_at
         ,user_type = member_casual)
```

#### Check new column names:

```{r check names}
colnames(cyclistic_2021_2022)
```

#### Check data frame for missing values:

```{r checks for NAs}
any(is.na(cyclistic_2021_2022))
```

#### Set up cleaning environment and perform thorough review of data frame:

```{r set up clean}
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
```

```{r check df}
skim(cyclistic_2021_2022)
```

#### Note that there are:

-   5828235 rows the trip_id is a consistent string length at 16 characters

-   3 unique types of bikes

-   1591 unique start stations, which do not match the unique start station ids at 1302

-   1609 unique end stations, which do not match the unique end station ids at 1309

-   Both of these suggest that the station names are not consistent

-   Also, curious that the number of unique start and end stations is not the same.

-   895032 start stations and ids each are missing

-   958227 end stations and ids each are missing

-   0 missing start latitudes or longitudes

-   5844 missing end latitudes and longitudes each

-   2 unique user types no white spaces

#### Remove rows with missing values and check new row and column count. Create draft of new data frame:

```{r drop NAs}
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2 <- cyclistic_2021_2022 %>% drop_na(c(trip_id
,bike_type
,start_time
,end_time
,start_station_name
,start_station_id
,end_station_name
,end_station_id
,start_lat
,start_lng
,end_lat
,end_lng
,user_type))
dim(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2)
```

#### Recheck for duplicate ride_id values:

```{r check for duplicates}
sum(duplicated(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$trip_id))
```

#### Make sure that column names are unique and consistent:

```{r clean names}
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2 <- clean_names(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2)
```

#### Recheck number of distinct start and end station names:

```{r distinct counts}
n_distinct(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name)
n_distinct(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$end_station_name)
```

#### Recheck the data frame:

```{r skim df}
skim(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2)
```

#### Note that there are now:

-   5828235 rows went to 4474141

-   1480 unique start stations, which do not match the unique start station ids at 1252

-   1513 unique end stations, which do not match the unique end station ids at 1266

-   Also, curious that the number of unique start and end stations is not the same.

-   0 start stations and ids are missing

-   0 end stations and ids are missing

-   0 missing start latitudes or longitudes

-   0 missing end latitudes and longitudes

-   2 unique user types

#### Check start and end station names for maintenance and temp stations:

```{r list stations, results = "hide"}
table(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name)
table(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$end_station_name)
```

#### Remove warehouse, repair, and charging stations from start_station_name. Create new draft of data frame:

```{r remove rows}
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3 <- cyclistic_2021_2022_V2[!(cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Base - 2132 W Hubbard" | 
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse" |  
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse" |  
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Hastings WH 2" | 
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="DIVVY CASSETTE REPAIR MOBILE STATION" | 
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Throop/Hastings Mobile Station" | 
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Bissell St & Armitage Ave - Charging" | 
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Lincoln Ave & Roscoe St - Charging" | 
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Pawel Bialowas - Test- PBSC charging station" | 
cyclistic_2021_2022_V2$start_station_name=="Wilton Ave & Diversey Pkwy - Charging"),]
```

#### Remove warehouse, repair, and charging stations from end_station_name:

```{r remove more rows}
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3 <-  cyclistic_2021_2022_V3[!(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Base - 2132 W Hubbard" |
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse" |  
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Base - 2132 W Hubbard Warehouse" |  
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Hastings WH 2" |
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="DIVVY CASSETTE REPAIR MOBILE STATION" |
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Throop/Hastings Mobile Station" |
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Bissell St & Armitage Ave - Charging" |
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Lincoln Ave & Roscoe St - Charging" |
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Pawel Bialowas - Test- PBSC charging station" |
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_station_name=="Wilton Ave & Diversey Pkwy - Charging"),]
```

#### Recheck the data frame:

```{r skim df again}
skim(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3)
```

#### Note that there are now:

-   5828235 rows became 4474141 became 4472599

-   1472 unique start stations, which do not match the unique start station ids at 1245

-   1502 unique end stations, which do not match the unique end station ids at 1258

-   0 start stations and ids are missing

-   0 end stations and ids are missing

-   0 missing start latitudes or longitudes

-   0 missing end latitudes and longitudes

-   2 unique user types

#### Create new columns: date, month, day, year, and day_of_the_week for aggregation:

```{r create new columns}
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$date <- as.Date(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$start_time)
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$month <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$date), "%m")
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$day <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$date), "%d")
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$year <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$date), "%Y")
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$date), "%A")
colnames(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3)
```

#### Check that new columns created properly:

Note to change the manner by which a month name is referred from a number to a name.

View(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3)

#### Create column for trip duration, check that it was created in difftime:

Note to retype to integer.

```{r list data types}
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$trip_duration<- difftime(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$end_time, cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$start_time)
glimpse(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3)
```

#### Change trip_duration data type to integer for aggregation:

Note that trip_duration has trips under 60 seconds long (-7621 seconds) and trips over 86400 seconds long (over 24hrs [2442301 seconds]). Note that these outliers are likely representative of false starts, break downs, or theft and should be removed.

```{r recast data type}
cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$trip_duration<- as.numeric(as.character(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$trip_duration))
summary(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3)
```

#### Count number of trip_duration rows that are equal to or over 60 seconds and equal to or over 86400 seconds:

Note that 74443+269 = 74712.

```{r scan length}
length(which(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$trip_duration <= 60))
length(which(cyclistic_2021_2022_V3$trip_duration >= 86400))
```

#### Remove trips with false starts (60) or over 24hrs (86400) and create final version of the data frame:

Note that 4472599-74712 = 4397887.

```{r filter length}
cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN <- cyclistic_2021_2022_V3 %>%
  filter(trip_duration > 60 & trip_duration < 86400)
dim(cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN)
```

#### Recheck for outliers:

Note that there were none.

```{r rescan length}
length(which(cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN$trip_duration <= 60))
length(which(cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN$trip_duration >= 86400))
```

#### Create csv file "cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN":

write.csv(cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN, "cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN.csv")

#### Streamline working data frame name:

```{r streamline df name}
cyclistic_analysis<- cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN
```

## Aggregate, Analyze, and Visualize

#### Set up environment for more clear aggregation:

```{r set-up aggregation environment, message = FALSE}
library(scales)
library(data.table)
library(formattable)
```

```{r}
improvement_formatter <- formatter("span", style = x ~ style(font.weight = "bold", color = ifelse(x > .50, "tomato", ifelse(x < .50, "steelblue", "black")))
                                   , x ~ icontext(ifelse (x > .50, "arrow-up", "arrow-down"), x))
```

### Count rides and their percentage

#### Count rides and their percentage of total by user type:

```{r calculate percent total rides}
user_percent <- cyclistic_analysis %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarize(total_rides = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent=percent(total_rides/sum(total_rides),0))
```

```{r}
formattable(user_percent,
             align =c("l", "c","r"), 
             list('user_type' = color_tile("seashell2", "seashell3"), 'percent' = improvement_formatter))
```

#### Plot percentage of total rides by user type:

```{r plot percent total rides}
ggplot(user_percent, aes(x = "", y = percent, fill = user_type)) +
  geom_col(color = "black") +
  geom_label(aes(label = percent), color = c("white", 1), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),show.legend = FALSE) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Percentage of Total Rides by User Type")) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void()
```

#### Count rides by user type by month (total = 4397887):

Note that month references should be changed to names.

```{r list month counts}
table(cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN$month)
```

#### Change month reference from integer to name:

Note that names are out of order now that data type is changed to string.

```{r mutate months}
cyclistic_analysis <- cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN %>% mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)])
table(cyclistic_analysis$month)
```

#### Put months in order:

```{r order months}
cyclistic_analysis$month <- ordered(cyclistic_analysis$month, levels=c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug", "Sep", "Oct","Nov", "Dec"))
table(cyclistic_analysis$month)
```

### Count rides and their percentage by user type by month:

```{r}
rm(month_totals)
```

```{r calculate ride count by month}
 rides_by_month<- cyclistic_analysis %>%
  group_by(month, user_type) %>%
  summarize(total_rides = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = (percent(total_rides/sum(total_rides))))
formattable(rides_by_month,
             align =c("l","c","c"), 
           list('month' = color_tile("pink", "lightblue"), 'percent' = improvement_formatter))
```

#### Plot ride count by user type by month:

group_by(user_type, month)%>%
summarize(number_of_rides = n())%>%
arrange(user_type, month)%>%
ggplot(aes(x = month, y = number_of_rides, fill = user_type)) + geom_col(position = "dodge", color="black") +
  scale_fill_hue(l=40) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "User Type"))+
  ggtitle("Ride Count by User by Month")
```

  guides(fill = guide_legend (title = "User Type"))+
  ggtitle("Percentage Rides by User by Month")
```

#### Check total ride count for each user type by day of the week (total = 4397887):

```{r ride count by day}
table(cyclistic_2021_2022_CLEAN$day_of_week)
```

#### Put days of week in order:

```{r order days of week}
cyclistic_analysis$day_of_week <- ordered(cyclistic_analysis$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
table(cyclistic_analysis$day_of_week)
```

#### Count rides and their percentage by user type by day of the week:

  scale_fill_hue(l=40) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend (title = "User Type"))+
  ggtitle("Percentage of Rides by User by Day")
```

### Aggregate trip duration by user type and bike type

#### Aggregate column trip duration:

```{r aggregate trip durations}
round(summary(cyclistic_analysis$trip_duration)/60)
```

#### Aggregate trip duration by user type:

Note that the average duration of a casual user's ride is roughly twice as long as a member's ride.

```{r aggregate trip duration by user}
summary_trip_duration <- cyclistic_analysis %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarize(average_duration=round((mean(trip_duration))/60),

  scale_fill_hue(l=40) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend (title = "User Type"))+
  ggtitle("Average Trip Duration by User by Day")
```

### Total bike type usage by user type

#### Count rides and their percent of total by bike type:

```{r calculate percentages of bike type}
by_bike_type <- cyclistic_analysis %>%
